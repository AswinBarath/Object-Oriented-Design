## Outcomes from learning OOD/LLD

- Analyze, design, document the requirements through use case driven approach.
- Identify, analyze, and model structural and behavioral concepts of the system.
- Develop, explore the conceptual model into various scenarios and applications.
- Apply the concepts of architectural design for deploying the code for software.

## Project Objectives

To develop a project following the 12 exercises listed below:

1. To develop a problem statement. 
2. Develop an IEEE standard SRS document. Also develop risk management and project plan (Gantt chart). 
3. Identify Use Cases and develop the Use Case model. 
4. Identify the business activities and develop an UML Activity diagram. 
5. Identity the conceptual classes and develop a domain model with UML Class diagram. 
6. Using the identified scenarios find the interaction between objects and represent them using UML Interaction diagrams. 
7. Draw the State Chart diagram. 
8. Identify the User Interface, Domain objects, and Technical services. Draw the partial layered, logical architecture diagram with UML package diagram notation. 
9. Implement the Technical services layer. 
10. Implement the Domain objects layer. 
11. Implement the User Interface layer. 
12. Draw Component and Deployment diagrams.
